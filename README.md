# Divergence-Trading-Strategy
Continuation of the psychological threshold and trend detection project. Creation and implementation of a trading strategy based on bullish and bearish divergence detection, improved by ML model to decision making.

# üìà Algorithmic Trading on BNB/USDT (1h)

This project implements an advanced algorithmic trading framework for the **BNB/USDT** pair using 1-hour candlestick data. It combines **technical analysis**, **trend line detection**, and a **machine learning-based signal filter** to build a robust trading strategy.
